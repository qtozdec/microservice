## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Java/Spring Boot Services
```java
// Follow Spring Boot conventions
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/users")
@Validated
public class UserController {
    
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserController.class);
    
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable @Min(1) Long id) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript/React Frontend
```javascript
// Use ES6+ features
// Follow React best practices
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const UserComponent = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  // Implementation
};

export default UserComponent;
```

#### Kubernetes YAML
```yaml
# Use consistent formatting
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: service-name
  namespace: microservices
  labels:
    app: service-name
    version: v1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  # Configuration
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Java services
mvn test

# Frontend  
npm test

# Integration tests
cd tests/integration
npm test
```

#### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Performance Guidelines

- Database queries must be optimized
- API responses should be < 200ms average
- Memory usage should be monitored
- Use caching appropriately

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Test thoroughly** - All tests must pass
2. **Update documentation** - README, API docs, etc.
3. **Check code style** - Follow established conventions  
4. **Security review** - No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities
5. **Performance impact** - Consider resource usage

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Microservices Principles
- **Single Responsibility** - One service, one business domain
- **Loose Coupling** - Services communicate via APIs only
- **High Cohesion** - Related functionality grouped together
- **Data Ownership** - Each service owns its data
- **Fault Tolerance** - Handle failures gracefully

### API Design
```yaml
# OpenAPI 3.0 specification
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Service API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /api/v1/resource:
    get:
      summary: Get resources
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
        '400':
          description: Bad request
        '500':
          description: Server error
```

### Database Guidelines
- Use appropriate database per service
- Design normalized schemas
- Index frequently queried columns
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper transaction boundaries

### Security Guidelines
- JWT for authentication
- RBAC for authorization
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- HTTPS in production
