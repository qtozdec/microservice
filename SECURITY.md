# üîê Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | ‚úÖ                 |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication across all services
- **Password Encryption**: BCrypt hashing for user passwords  
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **SQL Injection Protection**: JPA/Hibernate parameterized queries
- **Input Validation**: Request validation and sanitization
- **Container Security**: Non-root containers with minimal privileges
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes namespace isolation
- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data

### Container Security

All containers are configured with security best practices:
- Run as non-root users
- Read-only root filesystems where possible
- Dropped capabilities
- Security contexts enforced
- Resource limits applied

### Database Security

- Encrypted connections (TLS)
- Separate database users for each service
- Schema-level permission isolation
- Connection pooling with limits
- Regular backup encryption

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Deployment

### 1. Change Default Credentials

**CRITICAL**: Update all default passwords before deployment:

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Update these critical values in .env:
# - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# - JWT_SECRET (minimum 256 bits)
# - REDIS_PASSWORD  
# - GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD
# - All database passwords
```

### 2. Generate Secure Secrets

```bash
# Generate JWT secret (256-bit)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate database passwords
openssl rand -base64 16

# Generate encryption keys
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 3. Configure TLS/SSL

For production deployments:
- Enable TLS for all external endpoints
- Configure cert-manager for automatic certificate management
- Use strong cipher suites
- Implement HSTS headers

## üö´ Security Warnings

### Never Commit These Files:
- `.env` files with actual credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- Database dumps with real data
- Kubernetes secrets in plaintext
- CI/CD tokens or keys

### Default Credentials (CHANGE IMMEDIATELY):
- PostgreSQL: `postgres` / `postgres_pass`
- GitLab: `root` / `gitlab_root_password`  
- Nexus: `admin` / (check container logs)
- JWT Secret: Currently uses placeholder

## üîç Security Scanning

### Integrated Security Tools

The platform includes automated security scanning:
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Code quality analysis
- Security linting in CI/CD pipeline

### Manual Security Checks

```bash
# Check for exposed secrets
git log --oneline | head -20
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Scan images
docker scout cves user-service:latest

# Check Kubernetes security
kubectl auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:default:default
```

## üéØ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email details to: security@[your-domain].com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What We Commit To

- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly updates on progress  
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available
- **Recognition**: Credit in security advisories (if desired)

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never hardcode secrets** in source code
2. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
3. **Validate all inputs** from users and external services
4. **Log security events** but never log sensitive data
5. **Keep dependencies updated** with security patches

### For Operations

1. **Regular security updates** for base images and dependencies
2. **Network segmentation** between environments
3. **Monitoring and alerting** for security events
4. **Regular backups** with encryption
5. **Access control reviews** quarterly

### For Infrastructure

1. **Principle of least privilege** for all service accounts
2. **Network policies** to restrict inter-pod communication
3. **Pod security standards** enforcement
4. **Regular certificate rotation**
5. **Security scanning** in CI/CD pipelines
